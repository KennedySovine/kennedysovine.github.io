# Admin Panel Project Management Fixes

This document describes the fixes applied to resolve project creation issues in the admin panel.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Capitalization Not Respected
**Problem**: When creating new projects during art upload, the project titles were being converted to lowercase, not respecting the user's intended capitalization.

**Solution**: 
- Modified the search input handler to preserve the original case
- Updated `showProjectDropdown()` to accept both original query and lowercase query for searching
- Project titles now maintain the exact capitalization as entered by the user

### 2. Projects Not Persisting
**Problem**: New projects created during art upload were temporary and not saved for reuse in future uploads.

**Solution**:
- Properly imported `admin-projects.js` module functions
- Updated `createNewProject()` to use `addTemporaryProject()` for persistence
- Modified form submission to call `makeProjectPermanent()` when art is uploaded
- Projects are now stored in `adminProjects` array and can be reused

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- Removed duplicate `showProjectDropdown()` function implementations
- Added proper module imports for project management
- Enhanced project display to show temporary status
- Added logging for debugging project creation/persistence

## Files Modified

1. **admin/admin.js**
   - Added import for `admin-projects.js` functions
   - Fixed capitalization preservation in search
   - Updated project creation and persistence logic
   - Removed duplicate functions
   - Updated config loading to use fallback approach

2. **admin/admin-projects.js**
   - Enhanced with better logging and error handling
   - Added utility functions for project management
   - Improved persistence logic

3. **admin/index.html**
   - Updated script loading to use modules
   - Changed config loading to use fallback approach

## How It Works Now

1. **Project Creation**: When user types a project name and selects "Create new project", the exact capitalization is preserved
2. **Persistence**: New projects are immediately stored in `adminProjects` array with temporary status
3. **Reuse**: Temporary projects appear in dropdown for future uploads
4. **Permanence**: When art upload completes, temporary projects become permanent and remain available

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Open admin panel
2. Start uploading art
3. Type a project name with mixed case (e.g., "My New Project")
4. Select "Create new project"
5. Complete the upload
6. Start another upload - the project should appear in dropdown with original capitalization
7. Project should be marked as permanent and reusable

## Security Notes

- Project data is stored client-side only
- No sensitive information is stored in project data
- Projects reset when page is refreshed (by design for admin panel)
- For permanent storage, consider integrating with GitHub API or local storage
